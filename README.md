# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

This project aims to develop a predictive model for heart disease detection using both Machine Learning (Random Forest) and Deep Learning (Neural Network) techniques. The dataset is processed with advanced feature engineering and outlier handling, and the models are thoroughly evaluated using various metrics. The project also includes model interpretability using SHAP values and extensive visualizations for a clear understanding of the data and model performance.
